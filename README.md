# About
Win32 application for modeling dynamic systems and image recognition-based synchronization detection.

# How to use

## Ready-To-Use Builds
Download the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/icosane/vervain/releases).

## Building Locally
>
Use ```syncdetect_local``` to run it in the IDE of your choice. It expects all the additional files from ```/assets``` in the same directory. 
>
Use ```syncdetect_executable``` to build it with [pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) or [auto-py-to-exe](https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/). 
>
For ```auto-py-to-exe``` you can use my build template ```build_settings_git.json```.

## Keras model
The file is too big to commit. It can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/icosane/vervain/releases/tag/v0.5) instead.
>
Use ```sync_model.keras```
