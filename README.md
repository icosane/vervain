# About
Win32 application for modelling dynamic systems and using image recognition to detect synchronisation.

# How to use

## Ready-To-Use Builds
Download the latest release from [releases](https://github.com/icosane/vervain/releases).

## Building Locally/using your own libraries
You can also run it using the ```.py``` files. 
>
Use ```syncdetect_local``` to run it in your IDE of choice. It expects all the additional files from ```/assets``` in the same directory. 
>
Use ```syncdetect_executable``` to build it using [pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) or [auto-py-to-exe](https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/). 
>
For ```auto-py-to-exe``` you can use my build template ```build_settings_git.json```.

## Keras Model used in this project
The file is too large to commit. Can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/icosane/vervain/releases/tag/v0.5) instead.
>
Use ```sync_model.keras```
